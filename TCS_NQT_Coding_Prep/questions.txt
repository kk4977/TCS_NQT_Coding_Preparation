2. given an n of of array elements, write a function to search the given element x in array
Q3 - Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
(Contains Duplicate - Leetcode)

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Q4 - Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1 (uniquenum.py)

Q5 - Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Q6 - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
(Two Sum - Leetcode)

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
